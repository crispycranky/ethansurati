        <p>I graduated from Indiana State University in December 2024 with a degree in Data Sciences and have always had a passion for creating and managing projects, whether for fun or work. As a first-generation American, with both of my parents coming from abroad, I take pride in my diverse background. Over the years, I've created fun projects like a Discord bot that impersonates my friends and various 3D-printed physical items, which you may find on this website.

            My first job was as a meat cutter at Needler's Fresh Market, and I also used to post frequent YouTube videos. Currently, I focus on web development, mainly working with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and back-end DBMS applications, including SQL and NoSQL programs.
            
            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and spend most of my day on the computer. I'm also an avid collector of swords and military arms and armor, including 14th-century knight armor and a 1500s replica of Japanese samurai armor. Lastly, I enjoy airsoft as a hobby.
